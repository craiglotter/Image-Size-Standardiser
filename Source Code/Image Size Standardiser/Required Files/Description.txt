Image Size Standardiser

Image Size Standardiser allows you to force all the image files in a specified folder to either a specific width or height in pixels. The images are all stretched or shrunk to meet the required measure (the original aspect ration is retained however - only a single variable can be altered). The resized files are all saved as JPG files.

All image files are backed up before the process is undertaken, meaning that it is possible to restore an image folder to its original state.

Note that the folder parsing is not recursive in nature.
