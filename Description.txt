Image Size Standardiser

Image Size Standardiser allows you to force all the image files in a specified folder to either a specific width or height (in pixels). The images are all stretched and shrunk to meet the required measure, though this is done while maintaining the image's original aspect ratio.

The files are all backed up before the process is undertaken.
